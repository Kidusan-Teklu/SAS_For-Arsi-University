# MongoDB Implementation Summary

## Compliance with Documentation Requirements

The implementation now meets the requirements specified in the Documentation.txt file:

1. **Database Technology**: Using MongoDB as specified in the documentation (section 1.8.1)
2. **Data Structure**: Implemented the collections as described in the documentation (section 4.2.2)
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented user roles as specified in the documentation (section 4.2.2.1)
4. **Authentication**: Implemented secure authentication with password hashing
5. **Face Recognition Integration**: Backend ready to store and retrieve facial recognition data

## What Was Done

1. **Fixed Database Configuration**:
   - Configured Django to use MongoDB through Djongo
   - Resolved migration issues by using a custom migration approach
   - Removed SQLite dependency

2. **Set Up MongoDB Collections**:
   - Created script to initialize MongoDB collections
   - Added sample data for testing
   - Implemented proper relationships between collections

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Created custom authentication backend for MongoDB
   - Implemented middleware for maintaining MongoDB user sessions
   - Added role-based access control

4. **Django Admin Integration**:
   - Registered MongoDB models with the Django admin
   - Customized admin interfaces for better usability
   - Made admin interface aware of MongoDB models

5. **Verification and Testing**:
   - Created a data verification script
   - Made sure Django can read and display MongoDB data
   - Added debugging tools

## Documentation Updates

The backend implementation now matches the documentation in these key areas:

1. **Collection Structure** (section 4.2.2):
   - `users` collection (with role-based access)
   - `students` collection
   - `employees` collection
   - `attendance` collection
   - `schedules` collection
   - `notifications` collection

2. **Technology Stack** (section 1.8.1):
   - Django backend
   - MongoDB database
   - Face recognition integration

3. **Authentication and Security** (section 5.2.5):
   - Password hashing
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure session management

## Additional Features

1. **Custom MongoDB Authentication**:
   - Users are stored in MongoDB but can log in through Django admin
   - Session state maintained between MongoDB and Django

2. **Migration Management**:
   - Custom solution to bypass Django migration issues with MongoDB
   - No need to modify the database schema directly

3. **Troubleshooting Tools**:
   - Scripts to verify database connectivity
   - Tools to check data consistency
